# A little app to create panic board panels.

## How to create a panel called 'tweets'

  1. Add a '/tweets' route into app.rb that serves some html
  2. Add custom css if desired at public/panels/tweets.css
  3. Add a js file at public/panels/tweets.js

  Now, just run your server

  $ rackup

  You can use the helper methods in public/application.js to update data periodically.
